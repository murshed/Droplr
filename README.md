"With an incredible feature set, active development, and a sustainable business model, Droplr is our favorite way to share files, make simple annotations, and track links." - The Sweet Setup


How it Works


To capture a screenshot or make a screencast, use convenient hotkeys or choose appropriate feature icon in the menu bar and choose a feature icon. Once you do that, a crosshair appears. Select the area on your screen with the crosshair and capture a screen or start recording. The screenshots and screencasts are ready to send immediately after you finish capturing them. It couldn’t be more convenient!


To share a file, just drag the file into the Droplr icon in your Mac menu bar. Once you do that, your file is instantly uploaded to your Droplr account in the cloud and a link to it is copied. Paste the link into the communication platform you use and send. Saving the files in a cloud and sending the access to it in a form of a link makes it possible to send even large files within seconds.
